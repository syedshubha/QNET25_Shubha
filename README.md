<b> Enhancing Quantum Teleportation Fidelity Using Stabilizer Codes and Entropy Analysis </b>


Quantum teleportation is a key communication protocol for transmitting quantum states over spatial distances using entanglement as a resource. However, imperfections in entanglement, due to noise channels can decrease teleportation fidelity. This research uses the Lindblad master equation to model amplitude and phase damping errors, offering a robust description of entanglement loss in the EPR pair used as a teleportation resource [1-2]. Stabilizer error correction codes are then applied to correct single-qubit errors to enhance entanglement and fidelity of teleported state [2]. Entanglement of Formation is calculated before and after error correction to quantify entanglement recovery, while quantum discord serves as an additional metric for residual non-classical correlations where entanglement degrades [3]. This study evaluates the efficacy of stabilizer codes under Lindblad-modeled noise, providing insights into the dynamics of information transfer in noisy quantum channels. The findings contribute to optimizing error-corrected quantum channels for practical quantum communication applications.
